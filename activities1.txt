activity 1: transform binary to decimal and vice versa

    2 - 10

    1. store the binary as a string
    2. iterate through the array backwards
        a. every iteration, double a count variable starting with count=1
        b. check if current element in string is a 1, if yes, add the current count to the sum
    3. final sum should be the converted integer

    10-2

    1. store the integer as the quotient variable
    2. store base '2' as the divisor variable
    3. use a while to loop until the quotient is 0
        a. get new quotient by dividing the current quotient by the divisor
        b. get the remainder by finding the modulus of the current quotient and the divisor
        c. store each remainder in an array
    4. iterate through the remainder array backwards and print each element without spaces
    5. output should be the converted binary number 

activity 2: base 10 - base 8 and vice versa

    this is the same as the previous question except the divisor is 8 instead of 2

activity 3: convert base 10 - base 16 (hexadecimal)

    this is the same as the previous question with one added component:
        remainders above 10 must be converted to a character 10 - A, 11 - B, etc. upto 15

prac 1

1-1 - print sum of array ()
1-2 - gets average of array ( set sum as double )
1-3 - number of elements in array equal to certain parameter
1-4 - sum of two arrays equal in size
1-5 - count number of even numbers between 1 and a parameter ( if num % 2 == 0, "even")

2-1 - find smallest int in array
2-2 - find biggest int in array
2-3 - find count of paramters in array
2-4 - determine if array is ascending order
2-5 - determine if array is descending order

3-1 - determine if fan array
iterate through to n/2 of array. If array[n+1] > array[n], then first fan is false. iterate from n/2 to n, if n > n/2, fan 2 is false
3-2 - sort an array and find the median
iterate through the array, if the current number is greater than the next number, swap them (place the first number in temp)
3-3 find weighted average.
get count of each number in array, times number by count and divide by total amount of numbers in array. Do this for all numbers and sum them. get count using nested for loop
3-4 output char grades for int numbers - use a switch statement
3-5 iterate through array, check for even (num % 2 == 0), sum if true


prac 2

1-1 - sum of diagonals in matrix
1-2 - check if matrix is identity. check if diagonals are all 1, check if outers are all 0.
1-3 - get count of each number. use a nested for loop
1-4 - iterate through the array and output the scaled by parameter version of the current element
1-5 - add two arrays together and output it
